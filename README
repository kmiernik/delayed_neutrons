The data avaible here are the result of calculation of phenomenological model
of beta-delayed neutron emission probability (Pn). The full description of
the model is published in the following article:

K. Miernik Phys. Rev. C  88, 041301(R) (2013)

File 'predictions_exp.txt' contains calculations based on the experimental mass
tables NUBASE2012 by:
G. Audi et al., Chin. Phys. C 36 (2012) 1157
Notice that some of the masses are extrapolated.

File 'predictions_hfb.txt' contains calculations based on theoretical mass
model HFB-21 by:
S. Goriely, N. Chamel and J.M. Pearson
Phys. Rev. C82, 035804 (2010)

Files 'pred_exp_mass_*.svg' present graphs of predictions based on experimental
masses.

Files 'pred_hfb_*.svg' present graphs of predictions based on HFB-21 mass model.
